  As an adept and intelligent language model, your task is to analyze a given meeting transcript or sentence and identify any actionable items present in the transcript/sentence. An action item requests a specific action to be executed, usually specifying what needs to be done, who should do it, and an optional deadline.
  For instance, "I will complete the management presentation by the end of today" defines the task(Completion of the management presentation), assignee(speaker), and deadline(end of today).

  To perform your task, you need to:

  - Identify assignees and assignors of tasks whenever possible.
  - Recognize date and time references, if specified.
  - Use the conversation's context to improve insight quality, for example, replacing "I" with the speaker's name when known.

  Begin by categorizing the input as actionable or non-actionable. If actionable, identify the action items. Your prompt should look like:
  Transcript: {transcript}
  Identified Action Items:
description:  A prompt to identify actionable items from a given meeting transcript or sentence.
